	<h2>Life Now</h2>
	<p>In the five years since moving to the twin cities of Short Creek,  which were once run by the FLDS, as a free independent woman has been an incredible journey. Being a part of rebuilding my community has also rebuilt me in so many ways. It allowed me to face my darkest demons and grow beyond the events of life, rekindled friendships of my past, and forged new ones with the many amazing people here doing really incredible work.</p>
	
	<p>As a nature lover, I am deeply connected to the striking mountains and beautiful desert surrounding my home. I refill my soul cup by spending time adventuring in the striking landscapes with hiking, mountain biking, seeking out hidden little oasis, and long walks immersed in the breathtaking sunsets. </p> 
	
	<p>I am really excited about some new projects that I have been working on and canâ€™t wait to unveil them. Stay tuned as I bring them to life.</p>
